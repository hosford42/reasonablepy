      Reasonable Python - INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------

CAUTION: Reasonable Python was only tested on kubuntu 
linux (using XSB and Flora2). If you manage to get it 
to work on another platform please let me know, I'll
be pleased to add your solution to the project.

Installation should be performed in the following way.
Since you are reading this document I assume you 
allready untared the Reasonable Python tar archive to
a folder, say ~/reasonable.

First thing to do, if you didn't allready, is to install:

- XSB Prolog engine (http://xsb.sourceforge.net)
- Flora2 (http://flora.sourceforge.net)
- ZODB (http://www.zope.org/Products/StandaloneZODB or with Debian aptitude install python-zodb)
- python-dev

After this steps first build Reasonable Python by 
issuing:

~/reasonable/python setup.py build --xsb /path/to/XSB/ --flora2 /path/to/flora2/

Where /path/to/XSB/ is the path to your XSB installation, 
and /path/to/flora2/ the path tou your Flora2 installation.

Additionally you can (should?) add the option:

--platform your-platform

Where your-platform is the platform specified in the 
path/to/xsb/config directory.

If build doesn't complain about any errors issue as
superuser:

python setup.py install

If nothing went wrong you should be able to use
Reasonable Python within your python installation
now.
